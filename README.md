#### As a data science and business analytics intern at The Sparks Foundation. I performed some tasks given to me.

## Task 1: 
##### Prediction using Supervised ML. This model is a simple linear regression model, with two features, hours and score. It predicts your score on the basis of how many hours a day you studied. To predict a score, use lm.predict() and enter the value of feature(hours) as a numeric value. Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
